## 🛠️ Tech Stack - Powering Apex Auth

Apex Auth leverages a carefully selected and powerful technology stack, ensuring optimal performance, security, and maintainability:

### **Frontend - Crafting a Seamless User Experience**

- ⚛️ **React** – The cornerstone of the frontend, React's component-based architecture enables the creation of **dynamic, reusable, and highly interactive user interface elements**. Its efficient virtual DOM rendering ensures a **smooth and responsive user experience**.
- 🎨 **CSS Modules** – For **modular and maintainable CSS styling**, CSS Modules solve the problem of global CSS namespace pollution by automatically scoping CSS to components. This approach significantly enhances **CSS organization and prevents styling conflicts** in larger projects.
- 🚦 **Redux / Context API** –  For **predictable and centralized state management**. Redux (or React's Context API, depending on project scale) provides a structured way to manage application state, making it easier to handle user sessions, authentication status, and application-wide data, leading to **more maintainable and testable frontend code**.
- 📡 **Fetch API / Axios** – Used for making **asynchronous HTTP requests to the backend RESTful API**. Fetch API (or the more feature-rich Axios library) simplifies the process of **fetching data and sending requests** between the frontend and backend, enabling seamless communication in modern web applications.
- 🎴 **Font Awesome** – Provides a vast library of **scalable vector icons**. Font Awesome icons are used throughout the frontend to enhance visual communication, improve user interface clarity, and add a professional touch to the design.
- 💬 **Toast Notifications** – For implementing **user-friendly, non-intrusive feedback mechanisms**. Toast notifications are used to display **brief, informative messages** to users, such as success confirmations or error alerts, without disrupting the user's workflow.

### **Backend - The Secure and Scalable Engine**

- 🚀 **Node.js + Express.js** – The backend is built using **Node.js for its event-driven, non-blocking architecture**, making it highly efficient for handling concurrent requests. **Express.js, a minimalist and flexible Node.js framework**, provides a robust set of features for building **RESTful APIs quickly and effectively**.
- 💾 **MongoDB + Mongoose** – **MongoDB, a NoSQL database**, is chosen for its **scalability, flexibility, and document-based data model**, which is well-suited for modern web applications. **Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js**, simplifies database interactions, provides schema validation, and enhances data management.
- 🔒 **JWT + Cookie-based Auth** –  Employs a **hybrid authentication approach combining JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication and HTTP-only cookies for secure session management**. JWTs are used to verify user identity, while cookies securely store session tokens, ensuring **robust and scalable user authentication**.
- 🔑 **bcryptjs** – For **securely hashing user passwords before storing them in the database**. `bcryptjs` is a widely respected and computationally intensive hashing algorithm, making it extremely difficult for attackers to crack passwords, even in the event of a database breach.
- 📧 **Nodemailer** – Enables the backend to **send emails, such as welcome emails, password reset emails, and account update notifications**. Nodemailer simplifies the process of sending emails from a Node.js server, supporting various email transport methods and security protocols.
- 🌐 **CORS** – **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware** is implemented to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend, especially when they are hosted on different origins (as is common in decoupled architectures and cloud deployments). CORS ensures that only authorized origins (like your frontend domain) can access the backend API, preventing unauthorized cross-site requests.
- ⚙️ **dotenv** – For **managing environment-specific configuration securely**. `dotenv` allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, keeping sensitive configuration details (like database connection strings, API keys, and secrets) **out of your codebase and easily configurable for different environments** (development, production, testing).

## ✨ Features - Unpacking the Power of Apex Auth

Apex Auth is rich in features, all meticulously designed to deliver a secure, user-friendly, and developer-centric authentication experience:

### 🔒 Secure Authentication - The Core of Apex Auth

- **User Registration with Robust Validation:**
    - **Comprehensive Registration Form:**  New users can easily create accounts by providing their **full name, a valid email address, and a secure password**. The registration process is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
        ```
        Screenshots/registration-form.png
        ```
        > *Example: A clean and accessible registration form prompting for essential user details.*

    - **Password and Confirm Password Matching:**  During registration, Apex Auth ensures **password confirmation accuracy** by implementing real-time checks to verify that the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields match perfectly. This prevents accidental registration with mismatched passwords, improving user experience and security.
        ```
        Screenshots/password-match-validation.png
        ```
        > *Example: Visual cues or error messages displayed if passwords do not match during registration.*

    - **Password Visibility Toggle with Auto-Close:**  To enhance user experience and password accuracy during registration and login, Apex Auth provides a **password visibility toggle**. Users can click an "eye" icon to temporarily reveal the password they are typing, ensuring they enter it correctly. The password automatically reverts back to masked asterisks after a short delay, maintaining security while offering convenience.
         ```
        Screenshots/password-visibility-toggle.gif
        ```
        > *Example: Animated GIF demonstrating the password visibility toggle in action, showing the auto-close feature.*

    - **Password Complexity Enforcement - Setting the Security Bar High:**  Apex Auth enforces **strong password policies** to minimize the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized account access.  The system validates passwords against strict criteria, ensuring they meet the following security standards:
        - **Minimum Length:** Passwords must be at least **8 characters long**, encouraging users to create substantial and harder-to-guess passwords.
        - **Uppercase Letter Requirement:**  Passwords must include **at least one uppercase letter**, increasing password complexity and entropy.
        - **Number Requirement:** Passwords must contain **at least one numerical digit**, further enhancing resistance to dictionary attacks.
        - **Special Symbol Requirement:** Passwords must include **at least one special symbol** (e.g., !@#$%^&*), significantly increasing password complexity and security.
        If a user attempts to register with a password that does not meet these stringent requirements, Apex Auth will **display clear and informative error messages**, guiding the user to create a stronger password. This proactive approach to password security is crucial for protecting user accounts and sensitive data.
         ```
        Screenshots/password-complexity-validation.png
        ```
        > *Example: Error messages displayed when a user attempts to register with a weak password that doesn't meet complexity requirements.*


- **User Login with JWT-Based Authentication:**
    - **Email and Password Login Interface:**  Registered users can securely access their accounts using their email address and password through a clean and intuitive login form.
        ```
        Screenshots/login-form.png
        ```
        > *Example: A user-friendly login form with fields for email and password.*

    - **JWT-Based Authentication Flow:** Upon successful login, the backend generates a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**. This JWT acts as a **digital signature** verifying the user's identity. The JWT is then securely stored as an HTTP-only cookie in the user's browser (see "Session Management" below). For subsequent requests to protected resources, the JWT cookie is automatically sent to the backend. The backend then verifies the JWT's signature, ensuring the request is authenticated and authorized. This **stateless JWT-based authentication** approach is highly scalable and secure.
         ```
        Screenshots/jwt-auth-flow-diagram.png
        ```
        > *Example: Diagram illustrating the JWT-based authentication flow, from login request to protected resource access.*

- **Google OAuth Login (Optional - Streamlining User Access):**
    - **Simplified Google Login Button:**  Apex Auth offers optional integration with Google OAuth, providing users with a **one-click login experience** using their existing Google accounts.  This feature significantly simplifies the signup and login process, enhancing user convenience and reducing friction.
        ```
        Screenshots/google-login-button.png
        ```
        > *Example: Prominent "Sign in with Google" button integrated into the login/signup page.*

    - **OAuth 2.0 Protocol Implementation:**  The Google OAuth login leverages the industry-standard **OAuth 2.0 protocol**, ensuring a secure and reliable authentication process. Upon successful Google authentication, the backend securely verifies the user's Google profile information and either creates a new user account (if it's their first time logging in with Google) or logs in an existing user. A JWT token and session cookie are then generated and managed just like with traditional email/password login, ensuring consistent session management across all authentication methods.
         ```
        Screenshots/google-oauth-flow-diagram.png
        ```
        > *Example: Flowchart depicting the Google OAuth login process from frontend initiation to backend user session creation.*


### 📧 User Engagement - Keeping Users Informed and Connected

- **Welcome Emails - A Warm Onboarding Experience:**
    - **Personalized Welcome Message:**  To enhance user onboarding and create a positive first impression, Apex Auth can be configured to send **automated welcome emails to new users immediately after successful registration**. These emails are personalized with the user's name and include a warm welcome message, encouraging them to explore the platform and highlighting key features.
         ```
        Screenshots/welcome-email-example.png
        ```
        > *Example: Sample content of a welcome email, highlighting personalized elements and key platform features.*

    - **Email Notifications for Account Updates (Optional):**  Beyond just welcome emails, Apex Auth can be extended to send **email notifications for other important user account actions**, such as:
        - **Profile Updates:**  Notifying users when their profile information has been successfully updated.
        - **Account Deletion Confirmation:** Sending a confirmation email when a user successfully deletes their account, providing a record of the action and any relevant information.
        These optional email notifications enhance user communication, provide transparency, and improve overall account security by keeping users informed about changes to their accounts.
         ```
        Screenshots/account-update-email.png
        Screenshots/account-deletion-email.png
        ```
        > *Example: Sample email notifications for account profile updates and account deletion confirmations.*

- **Toast Notifications - Real-time User Feedback:**
    - **Non-Intrusive Feedback:**  Apex Auth utilizes **toast notifications** throughout the application to provide users with **real-time, non-intrusive feedback** on their actions. Toast notifications are small, temporary messages that appear briefly on the screen, providing immediate feedback without interrupting the user's workflow.
    - **Success and Error Notifications:**  Toast notifications are used to communicate both **success and error scenarios**. For example:
        - **Success:** Displaying a "Sign-in successful!" toast upon successful login, or "Profile updated successfully!" after a profile update.
        - **Error:** Showing error toasts like "Invalid email or password." during login failures, or "Passwords do not match." during registration.
        ```
        Screenshots/success-toast-notification.png
        Screenshots/error-toast-notification.png
        ```
        > *Example: Screenshots showcasing both success and error toast notifications within the application interface.*


### 🛡️ Security Best Practices - Built-in Security Measures

- **CSRF & XSS Protection - Fortifying Against Web Vulnerabilities:**
    - **HTTP-only Cookies (XSS Mitigation):** By setting the `HttpOnly` attribute on session cookies, Apex Auth **significantly reduces the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks**. `HttpOnly` cookies cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript, preventing attackers from stealing session cookies even if they manage to inject malicious scripts into the page.
    - **`SameSite` Cookie Attribute (CSRF Mitigation):**  The `SameSite` cookie attribute (set to `'Lax'` or `'Strict'` depending on deployment environment, or `'None'` for cross-site scenarios like Render) provides **protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks**. `SameSite` controls when cookies are sent in cross-site requests, helping to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
    - **Input Sanitization (Backend):**  While not explicitly shown in the README, a production-ready Apex Auth implementation would also include **robust input sanitization on the backend** to prevent various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection). Validating and sanitizing user inputs before database queries and processing is a critical security measure.

- **Secure Cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) - Ensuring Cookie Security:**
    - **`HttpOnly` Attribute:** As mentioned above, `HttpOnly` is set to **prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing the session cookie**, mitigating XSS attacks.
    - **`Secure` Attribute:** The `Secure` attribute ensures that cookies are **only transmitted over HTTPS connections**. This is crucial for protecting session cookies from being intercepted in man-in-the-middle attacks. In a production environment (like Render), HTTPS is essential, and the `Secure` attribute should always be enabled.
    - **`SameSite` Attribute:** The `SameSite` attribute controls **cookie behavior in cross-site contexts**. Apex Auth configures `SameSite` appropriately for different deployment scenarios:
        - **`'Lax'` or `'Strict'` (for Same-Site Deployments):**  In scenarios where the frontend and backend are on the same origin (e.g., same domain or subdomain), using `'Lax'` or `'Strict'` `SameSite` provides the strongest CSRF protection. `'Strict'` offers the most robust protection but might be too restrictive in some cases. `'Lax'` is often a good balance.
        - **`'None'` (for Cross-Site Deployments - e.g., Render):**  In cloud deployment environments like Render, where the frontend and backend might be considered somewhat "cross-site" even within the same base domain (`onrender.com`), `SameSite: 'None'` (combined with `Secure: true`) might be necessary for cookies to be correctly sent and received. However, it's important to understand the security implications and use `'None'` only when necessary for cross-site cookie sharing and with the understanding that CSRF protection might need to be handled through other mechanisms in truly cross-site scenarios.

- **CORS Handling - Secure Cross-Origin Communication:**
    - **Backend CORS Configuration:**  Apex Auth implements **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the backend** to control which origins (domains) are allowed to make requests to the API. This is essential for allowing your frontend application (hosted on `apex-auth-frontend.onrender.com`) to securely access your backend API (on `apex-auth.onrender.com`).
    - **`cors` Middleware:**  The backend utilizes the `cors` middleware in Express.js to configure CORS headers. The configuration typically includes:
        - **`origin`:**  Specifying the allowed frontend origin(s) (e.g., `https://apex-auth-frontend.onrender.com`).
        - **`methods`:**  Defining the allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
        - **`allowedHeaders`:**  Controlling which headers are allowed in cross-origin requests (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`).
        - **`credentials: true`:**  Enabling the sending of cookies and HTTP authentication credentials in cross-origin requests, which is necessary for cookie-based session authentication to work across origins.
    CORS handling ensures that your backend API is protected from unauthorized access from malicious websites while allowing legitimate cross-origin requests from your frontend application.

### 👤 Profile Management - User Empowerment and Control

- **View Profile Details:**  Logged-in users have access to a dedicated profile section where they can **view their account information**. This typically includes details like their username, email address, full name, and profile picture (if applicable).
    ```
    Screenshots/view-profile-page.png
    ```
    > *Example: Screenshot of a user profile page displaying viewable user details.*

- **Update Profile Information:**  Users can **modify and update their profile details** directly within the application. This could include changing their full name, updating their profile picture, or other relevant profile information.
    ```
    Screenshots/edit-profile-page.png
    ```
    > *Example: An "Edit Profile" page with editable fields for user details.*

    - **Email Notifications for Profile Updates (Optional):** As mentioned in "User Engagement," Apex Auth can be extended to send **email notifications to users whenever they successfully update their profile information**. This provides users with confirmation of their changes and enhances account activity transparency.

- **Account Deletion - User Agency and Data Control:**  Apex Auth empowers users with **full control over their data by providing a clear and straightforward account deletion option**. Users can initiate the process to permanently delete their account and associated data from the application.
    ```
    Screenshots/delete-account-confirmation.png
    ```
    > *Example: A confirmation dialog or page for account deletion, emphasizing the permanent nature of the action.*

    - **Account Deletion Confirmation Email (Optional):**  Upon successful account deletion, Apex Auth can send a **confirmation email to the user**. This email serves as a final confirmation of the account deletion request and provides users with a record of their action. It may also include information about data removal and any post-deletion steps.

### 🚀 Modern Architecture - Building for Scalability and Maintainability

- **Frontend & Backend Separation - Decoupled for Scalability:**  Apex Auth is architected with a **clear separation between the frontend user interface and the backend API server**. This decoupled architecture offers significant advantages:
    - **Scalability:**  Frontend and backend can be scaled independently based on their specific load requirements. For example, you can scale the backend API server horizontally to handle increased API requests without needing to scale the frontend static assets.
    - **Independent Development and Deployment:**  Frontend and backend teams can work independently, using their preferred tools and workflows. Deployments can also be decoupled, allowing for faster and more frequent frontend updates without requiring backend redeployments (and vice-versa, for backend changes that don't affect the frontend interface).
    - **Technology Flexibility:**  Decoupling allows for greater flexibility in technology choices. You could, for instance, decide to migrate the frontend to a different framework in the future without significantly impacting the backend API, or vice-versa.
    - **Maintainability:**  A decoupled architecture leads to a more organized and maintainable codebase. Code is separated into logical units (frontend and backend), making it easier to understand, debug, and update.
    ```
    Screenshots/frontend-backend-architecture-diagram.png
    ```
    > *Example: Diagram visually representing the decoupled frontend and backend architecture, highlighting API communication.*

- **RESTful API Communication - Standardized Data Exchange:**  The frontend and backend communicate exclusively through a **well-defined RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)**. RESTful APIs are a widely adopted standard for building web services, offering numerous benefits:
    - **Standardized Communication:** REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and JSON for data exchange, making communication predictable and easy to understand.
    - **Statelessness:** REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from the frontend to the backend contains all the necessary information for the server to process it. This statelessness enhances scalability and simplifies server-side logic.
    - **Interoperability:** REST APIs are highly interoperable, allowing different frontend technologies (React, Angular, Vue.js, mobile apps, etc.) to easily consume the same backend API.
    - **Discoverability:** Well-designed REST APIs are self-documenting to some extent, making it easier for developers to understand the available endpoints and data structures.
    - **Scalability:** RESTful architectures are inherently scalable due to their stateless nature and the ability to easily distribute API servers.
    ```
    Screenshots/restful-api-endpoints-example.png
    ```
    > *Example: Snippet or table showcasing example RESTful API endpoints and request/response structures.*

- **Scalable & Maintainable Codebase - Built for Longevity:**  Apex Auth is developed with a strong emphasis on **code quality, maintainability, and scalability**:
    - **Modular Code Structure:**  Both the frontend and backend codebases are organized into modules and components, promoting code reusability, easier navigation, and reduced complexity.
    - **Well-Commented Code:**  Code is thoroughly commented to enhance readability and understanding, making it easier for developers (including yourself in the future) to maintain and extend the project.
    - **Consistent Coding Style:**  Adherence to consistent coding style conventions (e.g., using linters and formatters) makes the codebase more uniform and easier to collaborate on.
    - **Error Handling and Logging:**  Robust error handling is implemented throughout both frontend and backend, with appropriate error messages displayed to users and detailed error logging on the backend for debugging and monitoring.
    - **Environment Variable Configuration:**  Using `dotenv` for environment variables promotes configuration best practices, making it easier to manage different settings for development, testing, and production environments without hardcoding sensitive information.
    These practices contribute to a codebase that is not only functional but also robust, adaptable to future changes, and easier to maintain over time.

## 💻 Getting Started - Setting Up Your Local Development Environment

Ready to dive into the code and start developing with Apex Auth? Follow these simple steps to set up your local development environment:

### ⚙️ Prerequisites - Tools You'll Need

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later is recommended for modern JavaScript features and performance): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** or **yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: These package managers are used to install project dependencies. npm is included with Node.js, and yarn can be installed separately: [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- **MongoDB** (Community Server or MongoDB Atlas): You'll need a running MongoDB instance for the backend to connect to. You can either install MongoDB Community Server locally [Install MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) (which offers a free tier).

---

### 🌐 Frontend Installation - Setting Up the React Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the `frontend` folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:** Once you are inside the `frontend` directory, run the following command to install all the necessary npm packages listed in the `package.json` file. This includes React libraries, styling dependencies, and other frontend tools:

    ```bash
    npm install  # If you are using npm
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install # If you are using Yarn
    ```

    This command will download and install all the project's frontend dependencies into the `node_modules` folder within your `frontend` directory.

---

### ⚙️ Backend Installation - Setting Up the Node.js/Express Backend

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:** In your terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder of your project:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**  Similar to the frontend, run the appropriate command to install all backend dependencies listed in the `package.json` file within the `backend` directory. This will install Express.js, Mongoose, JWT libraries, and other backend-related packages:

    ```bash
    npm install  # If you are using npm
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install # If you are using Yarn
    ```

    This will install all backend dependencies into the `node_modules` folder within your `backend` directory.

---

### 🔧 Environment Variables Setup - Configuring Your Local Environment

To run the backend application locally, you need to configure environment variables. These variables contain sensitive information like your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** Inside the **`backend/`** directory, create a new file named `.env`. **Ensure it's named exactly `.env` (no extra characters or extensions).**

2.  **Add environment variables to `.env`:** Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following lines, **replacing the placeholder values** with your actual configuration details.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=5000                 # Port for your backend server to listen on (e.g., 5000, 3000, etc.)
    NODE_ENV=development      # Set to 'development' for local development mode

    # Database Configuration
    MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING # Your MongoDB connection string (local or MongoDB Atlas)

    # Authentication Secrets
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY        # A strong, random secret key for JWT signing (generate a secure key)

    # Email Service Configuration (Optional - for welcome emails etc.)
    SENDER_EMAIL=YOUR_EMAIL@example.com       # Your email address for sending emails (if email functionality is used)
    SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD    # Password or App Password for your sender email account

    # Frontend URL (for CORS during development)
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173      # URL where your frontend will run locally (typically http://localhost:5173 for React)
    ```

    **Important Notes:**

    -   **Replace Placeholders:**  Carefully replace `YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`, `YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `YOUR_EMAIL@example.com`, and `YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual values.
    -   **`JWT_SECRET_KEY` Security:**  Generate a **strong, random, and secret string** for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. This key is crucial for the security of your JWT authentication. Keep it confidential and do not commit it to your version control repository directly.
    -   **`MONGO_URI` (MongoDB Connection String):**  Provide a valid MongoDB connection string. If you are running MongoDB locally, it might look something like `mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name`. If you are using MongoDB Atlas, get the connection string from your Atlas dashboard.
    -   **Email Configuration (Optional):**  The `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD` variables are only needed if you are using email functionality (like welcome emails). If you are not using email features, you can leave these blank or comment them out. If you do use email, configure your email provider's details correctly. For Gmail, you might need to use an "App Password" instead of your regular Gmail password for security reasons.
    -   **`.env` File Security:**  The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive environment variables to your Git repository.

---

### ▶️ Running the Application - Launching Frontend and Backend

Once you have installed dependencies and configured environment variables, you are ready to run the Apex Auth application locally:

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    -   Open your terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:

        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```

    -   Run the command to start the backend server in development mode. This command typically uses `nodemon` (if installed) for automatic server restarts on code changes, which is helpful during development:

        ```bash
        npm run dev  # If you have a "dev" script in your backend's package.json
        ```

        or

        ```bash
        yarn dev # If you use Yarn and have a "dev" script
        ```

        If you don't have a `dev` script, you can use `npm start` or `node index.js` to start the server, but you'll need to restart it manually after code changes.

    -   **Verify Backend Startup:**  Look for console messages in your terminal indicating that the backend server has started successfully and is running on the port you configured (e.g., `Server running on port 5000`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    -   Open a **new terminal window or tab** (keep the backend server running in the first terminal).
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```

    -   Run the command to start the frontend development server. For React projects, this is usually `npm start` or `yarn start`:

        ```bash
        npm run start # If you are using npm
        ```

        or

        ```bash
        yarn start # If you are using Yarn
        ```

        -   **Verify Frontend Startup:**  The frontend development server should automatically open your default web browser and load the Apex Auth application. You should also see console messages in your terminal indicating that the frontend development server has started and is running (typically on `http://localhost:5173`).

3.  **Access the Application in Your Browser:**

    -   If the frontend development server did not automatically open your browser, manually open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and go to the URL where the frontend is running. By default, for React projects, this is usually:

        ```
        http://localhost:5173
        ```

    -   You should now be able to access the Apex Auth frontend application running in your browser, and it should be communicating with your backend server running in the other terminal window. You can now test the registration, login, and other authentication features of your application in your local development environment.

We warmly welcome contributions from the open-source community to help improve and expand Apex Auth! If you're interested in contributing, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **🍴 Fork the Repository:**  Start by forking the Apex Auth repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your username where you can make changes.

2.  🌱 **Create a Feature Branch:**  Before making any changes, create a new branch in your forked repository. It's best practice to create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix you are working on. Use a descriptive branch name:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature # For new features
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-error   # For bug fixes
    ```

3.  🛠️ **Make Your Changes:**  Now, make the code changes you want to contribute. This could be adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or refactoring existing code. Follow the project's coding style and best practices.

4.  ✅ **Commit Your Changes:**  Once you have made your changes, commit them to your local branch. Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you have made. Use imperative mood in your commit messages (e.g., "Add new user profile component", "Fix login form validation error").

    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Add descriptive commit message here'
    ```

5.  🚀 **Push Your Branch:**  Push your feature branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-new-feature
    ```
