        ```
        Screenshots/registration-form.png
        ```

        > *Example: A clean and accessible registration form prompting for essential user details.*

    *   **Password Complexity Enforcement:**  Guarantees strong password creation by enforcing policies including:

        *   Minimum **8 characters** in length
        *   At least **one uppercase letter**
        *   At least **one number**
        *   At least **one special symbol** (e.g., `!@#$%^&*)`

    *   **Real-time Validation:**  Offers immediate feedback to users, ensuring passwords meet security criteria before submission.

        ```
        Screenshots/password-complexity-validation.png
        ```

        > *Example: Error messages displayed when a user attempts to register with a weak password that doesn't meet complexity requirements.*

*   **Google OAuth Login (Streamlining User Access):**

    *   **One-Click Google Sign-In:**  Provides a seamless login option via Google accounts, enhancing user convenience and accessibility. Utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure, token-based session management, automatically managing user creation and login processes.

        ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### üîí CSRF & XSS Protection

*   **HTTP-only Cookies (XSS Mitigation):**  Reduces session hijacking risks by preventing client-side JavaScript access to cookies.
*   **`SameSite` Cookie Attribute (CSRF Mitigation):**  Manages cookie behavior in cross-site contexts, effectively blocking unauthorized actions.
*   **Backend Input Sanitization:** Protects against injection attacks by rigorously validating and sanitizing all user inputs on the server-side.

### üîê Secure Cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)

*   **`HttpOnly`**: Restricts cookie access to HTTP requests, enhancing security against script-based attacks.
*   **`Secure`**: Ensures cookies are transmitted exclusively over HTTPS, securing data in transit.
*   **`SameSite`**: Configurable as `'Lax'`, `'Strict'`, or `'None'`, adapting cookie behavior to different deployment scenarios and security needs.

### üåç CORS Handling

*   **Cross-Origin Security:**  Precisely controls domain access to the API, preventing unauthorized cross-site requests.
*   **Backend Configuration:**  Employs `cors` middleware, allowing fine-grained control over origins, methods, and headers.
*   **`credentials: true`**: Enables secure, cookie-based cross-origin authentication, essential for modern web architectures.

## üë§ Profile Management

### üìÑ View & Update Profile

*   **View Profile:**  Allows users to access and review their personal details, including name, email, date of birth, gender, and address, promoting transparency and user control.

    ![Profile View](Screenshots/view-profile-page.png)

*   **Edit Profile:**  Provides users with the ability to modify and update their personal information, ensuring data accuracy and user empowerment.

    ![Edit Profile](Screenshots/edit-profile-page.png)

### üóëÔ∏è Account Deletion

*   **User-Controlled Deletion:**  Offers users a straightforward mechanism to permanently delete their accounts, reflecting a commitment to user agency and data privacy. Notifies users and ensures permanent account removal upon confirmation.

## üöÄ Modern Architecture

### üîó Frontend & Backend Separation

*   **Scalable:**  Enables independent scaling of frontend and backend components, optimizing resource utilization and performance.
*   **Maintainable:**  Promotes a modular codebase, simplifying updates and feature additions through clear separation of concerns.

### üì° RESTful API Communication

*   **Standardized HTTP Methods:**  Utilizes GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for structured and predictable API interactions.
*   **Stateless & Scalable:**  Enhances scalability and simplifies server-side processing through stateless request handling.
*   **Interoperable:**  Designed to support diverse frontend technologies, ensuring broad compatibility and future-proofing.
